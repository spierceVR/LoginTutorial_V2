# LoginTutorial_V2
* C++ & PHP/MySQL Login system
 
* Created by following along with a tutorial from {CodeByte} on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfBfcgbSgTCxx1IWYUXweuA

* Requires libcurl, probably some weird extra libs that make stuff not break, a MySQL database, and some php scripts for storing username/password combos to make requests to.
  * I used xampp for this, [these are the required php scripts](https://github.com/spierceVR/LoginTutorial_V2/tree/master/php_backend/htdocs/files)
  * Here's the other dependencies to link:
   * Ws2_32.Lib
   * Wldap32.Lib
   * Crypt32.Lib
   * Advapi32.lib
   * Normaliz.lib
