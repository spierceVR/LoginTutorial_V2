# LoginTutorial_V2
* C++ & PHP/MySQL Login system
 
* Created by following along with a tutorial from {CodeByte} on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfBfcgbSgTCxx1IWYUXweuA

* Requires [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/), a MySQL database, and some php scripts for storing username/password combos to make requests to.
  * I used [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) for the server/db, [these are the required php scripts](https://github.com/spierceVR/LoginTutorial_V2/tree/master/php_backend/htdocs/files)
  * Link these dependencies as well to make this not break:
    * Ws2_32.Lib
    * Wldap32.Lib
    * Crypt32.Lib
    * Advapi32.lib
    * Normaliz.lib
