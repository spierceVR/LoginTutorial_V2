# LoginTutorial_V2
* Created by following along with a tutorial from {CodeByte} on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfBfcgbSgTCxx1IWYUXweuA

* Client side of a C++ Login system

* Requires a MySQL database and some php scripts for storing username/password combos to make requests to.
** I used xampp for this, (these are the required php scripts)[https://github.com/spierceVR/LoginTutorial_V2/tree/master/php_backend/htdocs/files]
